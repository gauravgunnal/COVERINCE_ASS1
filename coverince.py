'''Q1'''
'''The three primary measures of central tendency are:

1. **Mean (Average)**:
   - The mean, often referred to as the average, is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the number of values (observations).
   - Formula: \[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}} \]
   - The mean is sensitive to outliers, as extreme values can significantly affect its value.

2. **Median**:
   - The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order.
   - If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.
   - The median is not affected by extreme outliers and provides a measure of central tendency that is more robust to skewed or non-normally distributed data.

3. **Mode**:
   - The mode is the value(s) that occur with the highest frequency in a dataset.
   - A dataset can have one mode (unimodal) or more than one mode (multimodal). It is possible for a dataset to have no mode if all values occur with the same frequency.
   - The mode is particularly useful for categorical or nominal data, but it can also be applied to continuous data.

These measures are used to summarize and describe the central or typical value in a dataset. The choice of which measure to use depends on the nature of the data and the specific characteristics of the dataset. The mean is commonly used for normally distributed data or data that is approximately symmetric, while the median and mode are often preferred for skewed or non-normally distributed data. Additionally, the mode is particularly useful for categorical data.'''

'''Q2'''
'''The mean, median, and mode are three distinct measures of central tendency used to describe the central or typical value of a dataset. Each measure provides a different perspective on the center of the data and is used in various contexts depending on the characteristics of the dataset.

Here are the key differences between the mean, median, and mode:

1. **Mean (Average)**:
   - Definition: The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values.
   - Calculation: \[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}} \]
   - Sensitivity to Outliers: The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) in the dataset. A single outlier can significantly affect the mean.
   - Use Cases: The mean is commonly used for datasets with a roughly symmetrical or normal distribution. It is suitable for data that can be well-approximated by a bell-shaped curve.

2. **Median**:
   - Definition: The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.
   - Calculation: The median does not have a simple formula like the mean; it involves ordering the data and finding the middle value(s).
   - Robustness to Outliers: The median is robust to outliers. Extreme values do not greatly affect the median, making it suitable for skewed or non-normally distributed data.
   - Use Cases: The median is often used when the data is skewed or contains outliers. It provides a measure of central tendency that is not strongly influenced by extreme values.

3. **Mode**:
   - Definition: The mode is the value(s) that occur with the highest frequency in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal) or more than one mode (multimodal). It is also possible for a dataset to have no mode if all values occur with the same frequency.
   - Calculation: The mode is determined by identifying the most frequently occurring value(s).
   - Applicability: The mode is particularly useful for categorical or nominal data, but it can also be applied to continuous data.
   - Use Cases: The mode is used to describe the most common or popular values in a dataset. It is relevant in situations where identifying the most frequent category or value is important.

In summary, these measures of central tendency provide different ways to summarize the center of a dataset:

- **Mean** represents the arithmetic average and is suitable for symmetric, normally distributed data.
- **Median** represents the middle value and is robust to outliers, making it suitable for skewed or non-normally distributed data.
- **Mode** represents the most frequent value(s) and is used for categorical or nominal data or to identify the most common values in a dataset.

The choice of which measure to use depends on the nature of the data and the specific research or analytical goals. Often, it is beneficial to consider multiple measures to gain a comprehensive understanding of the central tendency of the dataset.'''

'''Q3'''
'''To calculate the three measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) for the given height data, you can follow these steps:

Given data:
[178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]

**Step 1: Calculate the Mean (Average)**

The mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.

\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}} \]

Mean = (178 + 177 + 176 + 177 + 178.2 + 178 + 175 + 179 + 180 + 175 + 178.9 + 176.2 + 177 + 172.5 + 178 + 176.5) / 16

Mean ≈ 177.925

**Step 2: Calculate the Median**

To calculate the median, first, you need to sort the data in ascending order and then find the middle value(s).

Ordered data:
[172.5, 175, 175, 176, 176, 176.2, 177, 177, 178, 178, 178, 178, 178.2, 178.9, 179, 180]

Since there are 16 data points (an even number), the median is the average of the two middle values, which are 177 and 178:

Median = (177 + 178) / 2

Median = 177.5

**Step 3: Calculate the Mode**

The mode is the value(s) that occur with the highest frequency in the dataset. To find the mode, identify the value(s) that appear most often.

In the given data, the value 178 appears the most times (four times), making it the mode:

Mode = 178

So, for the given height data:
- Mean ≈ 177.925
- Median = 177.5
- Mode = 178

These measures of central tendency describe different aspects of the central or typical height in the dataset. The mean represents the average height, the median represents the middle height value, and the mode represents the most frequently occurring height.'''

'''Q4'''
'''To calculate the standard deviation for the given data, you can follow these steps:

Given data:
[178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]

**Step 1: Calculate the Mean (Average)**

We've already calculated the mean in a previous response:

Mean ≈ 177.925

**Step 2: Calculate the Variance**

The variance measures how individual data points deviate from the mean. You can calculate the variance using the formula:

\[ \text{Variance} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \text{Mean})^2 \]

Where:
- \( N \) is the number of data points.
- \( x_i \) represents each data point.
- \(\text{Mean}\) is the mean of the data.

Using the provided data and the mean we calculated earlier, calculate the squared differences for each data point, sum them, and then divide by the number of data points (16):

\[ \text{Variance} = \frac{1}{16} \sum_{i=1}^{16} (x_i - 177.925)^2 \]

The result is the variance.

**Step 3: Calculate the Standard Deviation**

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:

\[ \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\text{Variance}} \]

Let's perform the calculations:

- Calculate the squared differences for each data point:
  - (178 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.000006
  - (177 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.008425
  - (176 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.037025
  - (177 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.008425
  - (178.2 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.000073
  - (178 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.000006
  - (175 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.008825
  - (179 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.001200
  - (180 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.004310
  - (175 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.008825
  - (178.9 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.000943
  - (176.2 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.029727
  - (177 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.008425
  - (172.5 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.029346
  - (178 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.000006
  - (176.5 - 177.925)^2 ≈ 0.020225

- Sum of squared differences ≈ 0.177540

- Variance = Sum of squared differences / (Number of data points - 1) = 0.177540 / (16 - 1) ≈ 0.011836

- Standard Deviation = √(Variance) = √(0.011836) ≈ 0.10876 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the standard deviation for the given data is approximately 0.1088 (rounded to four decimal places).'''

'''Q5'''
'''Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide important information about how the data points are scattered or spread out from the central tendency measures (like the mean or median). Here's how each of these measures is used to describe the spread of a dataset, along with an example:

1. **Range**:
   - **Definition**: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion. It is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.
   - **Use**: The range provides a rough estimate of the extent of the spread in the data. It's a quick way to identify the data's spread without providing information about the distribution within that range.
   - **Example**: Consider the following dataset of exam scores (out of 100): [60, 75, 82, 92, 45, 98, 72]. The range is 98 - 45 = 53, indicating that the scores vary across a range of 53 points.

2. **Variance**:
   - **Definition**: Variance quantifies the average squared difference between each data point and the mean. It measures how far individual data points deviate from the mean.
   - **Use**: Variance provides a precise measure of the overall spread of the data. It accounts for the spread of all data points, taking into consideration the magnitude of each deviation from the mean.
   - **Example**: Using the same exam scores dataset as above, you can calculate the variance. After calculations, you find the variance to be approximately 324.96.

3. **Standard Deviation**:
   - **Definition**: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the typical or average deviation of data points from the mean.
   - **Use**: Standard deviation provides a more interpretable measure of the spread compared to the variance because it is in the same units as the data. It tells you how dispersed data points are relative to the mean.
   - **Example**: For the exam scores dataset, the standard deviation is approximately 18.03. This value indicates that, on average, the scores deviate from the mean by about 18.03 points.

In summary, measures of dispersion are crucial for understanding how data is spread or distributed. The range gives a basic idea of the spread, while variance and standard deviation provide more detailed information about how data points deviate from the central measure. When analyzing data, you may choose one or more of these measures depending on the level of precision and interpretation needed. For instance, in quality control, a small standard deviation might indicate a consistent manufacturing process, while a large standard deviation could suggest variability and inconsistency.'''

'''Q6'''
'''A Venn diagram is a visual representation used to illustrate the relationships and commonalities between different sets or groups of items. It consists of overlapping circles, each representing a distinct set, with the areas of overlap indicating the elements that are shared between those sets. Venn diagrams are widely used in various fields, including mathematics, logic, statistics, and data analysis, to visually represent set operations and relationships.

Key features of a Venn diagram:

1. **Circles**: Each circle in a Venn diagram represents a set, category, or group. The items or elements belonging to that set are enclosed within the circle.

2. **Overlap**: When circles in a Venn diagram overlap, the region of overlap represents the elements that are common or shared between the sets represented by those circles. The extent of the overlap can vary, indicating different levels of intersection.

3. **Non-overlapping Regions**: The non-overlapping portions of the circles represent the elements that are unique to each set, i.e., they belong to one set but not to the others.

4. **Universal Set**: Sometimes, a rectangle or larger circle enclosing all the smaller circles is used to represent the universal set, which contains all possible elements under consideration.

5. **Set Labels**: Typically, the circles or sets are labeled with letters (e.g., A, B, C) or descriptive names to identify them.

Common uses of Venn diagrams include:

- **Set Operations**: Venn diagrams are useful for visualizing set operations such as union (combining elements from multiple sets), intersection (finding common elements between sets), and complement (elements not belonging to a set).

- **Logic and Boolean Algebra**: In logic and Boolean algebra, Venn diagrams can help illustrate the relationships between logical propositions and operations, making it easier to understand logical concepts.

- **Statistics and Data Analysis**: Venn diagrams can be used to show the overlap between different categories or groups in data analysis, such as in market segmentation or survey responses.

- **Problem Solving**: Venn diagrams can aid in solving problems involving classification, categorization, and decision-making.

- **Education**: Venn diagrams are often used in educational settings to teach set theory, logic, and concepts related to mathematical and conceptual relationships.

Overall, Venn diagrams are a valuable tool for visualizing and clarifying relationships between sets, making complex concepts more accessible and easier to understand.'''

'''Q7'''
'''To find the union and intersection of the two given sets A and B:

Given sets:
A = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
B = {0, 2, 6, 8, 10}

(i) **Intersection (A ∩ B)**:
   - The intersection of two sets consists of all the elements that are common to both sets.
   - In set notation, \( A \cap B \) represents the intersection of sets A and B.

To find \( A \cap B \), identify the elements that are present in both sets A and B:

\( A \cap B = \{2, 6\} \)

So, the intersection of sets A and B, denoted as \( A \cap B \), is the set {2, 6}.

(ii) **Union (A ∪ B)**:
   - The union of two sets consists of all the elements from both sets, with duplicates removed.
   - In set notation, \( A \cup B \) represents the union of sets A and B.

To find \( A \cup B \), combine all the unique elements from both sets A and B:

\( A \cup B = \{0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10\} \)

So, the union of sets A and B, denoted as \( A \cup B \), is the set {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}.'''

'''Q8'''
'''Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data. It quantifies the degree to which a probability distribution or dataset deviates from being symmetric.

There are three common types of skewness:

1. **Positive Skew (Right Skew)**:
   - In a positively skewed distribution, the majority of the data points are concentrated on the left side (lower values) of the distribution, while a long tail extends to the right (higher values).
   - The mean is typically greater than the median in a positively skewed distribution because the tail on the right side pulls the mean in that direction.
   - Positively skewed distributions often arise in situations where there is a lower limit on the data (e.g., income, test scores) but no upper limit, leading to the skewness towards higher values.

2. **Negative Skew (Left Skew)**:
   - In a negatively skewed distribution, most of the data points are concentrated on the right side (higher values) of the distribution, while a long tail extends to the left (lower values).
   - The mean is typically less than the median in a negatively skewed distribution because the tail on the left side pulls the mean in that direction.
   - Negatively skewed distributions can occur when there is an upper limit on the data (e.g., response time, human lifespan) but no lower limit, leading to the skewness towards lower values.

3. **Zero Skew (Symmetric)**:
   - A distribution is considered symmetric (zero skew) when it is approximately balanced, and the left and right sides are mirror images of each other.
   - In a symmetric distribution, the mean and median are equal, and the data is evenly distributed around the central peak or mode.
   - Examples of symmetric distributions include the normal (Gaussian) distribution and the uniform distribution.

Skewness is a valuable statistic because it provides insights into the shape and nature of a dataset's distribution. Positive and negative skewness can affect the interpretation of data and statistical analyses. For example, when analyzing data with positive skew, the mean may overestimate the central tendency, while the median may provide a better measure of the typical value. Conversely, for negatively skewed data, the mean may underestimate the central tendency.

Understanding skewness is essential in various fields, including finance, economics, epidemiology, and data analysis, as it can influence decision-making, model selection, and statistical inferences. Analyzing the skewness of data helps researchers and analysts gain a deeper understanding of the underlying distribution and make more informed conclusions.'''

'''Q9'''
'''In a right-skewed distribution, also known as positively skewed, the majority of the data points are concentrated on the left side (lower values) of the distribution, while a long tail extends to the right (higher values). This means that there are relatively few extreme high values that pull the distribution's tail in the rightward direction.

In the context of the position of the median with respect to the mean in a right-skewed distribution:

1. **Mean**: The mean is typically greater than the median in a right-skewed distribution. This is because the presence of the long tail on the right side, which contains a few extremely high values, pulls the mean in the direction of those high values. As a result, the mean is higher than the median.

2. **Median**: The median is typically less than the mean in a right-skewed distribution. The median represents the middle value of the dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest. Since most of the data points are concentrated on the left side (lower values), the median is closer to the lower values, and it is less influenced by the extreme high values in the right tail.

In summary, in a right-skewed distribution:
- The mean is greater than the median.
- The median is a more robust measure of central tendency because it is less affected by extreme outliers in the right tail of the distribution.

Understanding the relationship between the mean and median in skewed distributions is important for data analysis, as it helps interpret the central tendency of the data and provides insights into the data's distribution shape.'''

'''Q10'''
'''Covariance and correlation are two related but distinct measures used in statistical analysis to describe the relationships between two or more variables, such as the degree to which they change together. While both covariance and correlation provide insights into how variables are related, they differ in terms of scale and interpretation.

Here are the key differences between covariance and correlation and how they are used in statistical analysis:

**Covariance**:

1. **Definition**: Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between the variables (i.e., whether they tend to increase or decrease together) but does not provide information about the strength of the relationship.

2. **Scale**: Covariance values are not standardized and can range from negative infinity to positive infinity. Therefore, the magnitude of covariance depends on the scales of the variables being measured.

3. **Units**: The units of covariance are the product of the units of the two variables being measured. This makes covariance challenging to interpret and compare across different datasets or variable scales.

4. **Interpretation**: A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to move in opposite directions. A covariance of zero suggests no linear relationship.

**Correlation**:

1. **Definition**: Correlation measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It provides a standardized measure of how closely the variables are related.

2. **Scale**: Correlation values range from -1 to 1, where:
   - -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship.
   - 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship.
   - 0 indicates no linear relationship.

3. **Units**: Correlation is a dimensionless measure, which means it is not affected by the units of measurement of the variables. This makes it easier to compare correlations across different datasets.

4. **Interpretation**: The correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient) quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship. A correlation coefficient close to -1 or 1 indicates a strong linear relationship, while a coefficient close to 0 suggests a weak or no linear relationship.

**Usage in Statistical Analysis**:

- **Covariance** is often used in statistical analysis to calculate the relationship between two variables, particularly when exploring data relationships. However, because covariance values depend on variable scales, it can be challenging to compare covariances across different datasets.

- **Correlation** is widely used in statistical analysis because it provides a standardized measure of the linear relationship between variables, making it easier to interpret and compare across different datasets. The Pearson correlation coefficient is commonly used for continuous variables, while other correlation measures, like the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, are used for ordinal or non-linear relationships.

In summary, covariance and correlation both measure the relationship between variables, but correlation provides a standardized measure that is easier to interpret and compare. Correlation is often preferred in practice because of its ability to quantify the strength and direction of linear relationships independently of variable scales.'''

'''The formula for calculating the sample mean (average) of a dataset is as follows:

\[ \text{Sample Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all data points}}{\text{Number of data points in the sample}} \]

To calculate the sample mean, follow these steps:

1. Add up (sum) all the data points in the dataset.

2. Count the number of data points in the dataset (the sample size).

3. Divide the sum of the data points by the sample size to find the sample mean.

Here's an example calculation:

Suppose you have the following dataset representing the scores of five students on a test:

\[ \text{Dataset:} \quad \{85, 92, 78, 88, 90\} \]

1. Calculate the sum of all data points:
   \[ 85 + 92 + 78 + 88 + 90 = 433 \]

2. Count the number of data points in the dataset (sample size):
   \[ \text{Sample Size} = 5 \]

3. Calculate the sample mean:
   \[ \text{Sample Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all data points}}{\text{Sample Size}} = \frac{433}{5} = 86.6 \]

So, the sample mean of the dataset is 86.6. This means that, on average, the students scored 86.6 on the test.'''

'''Q12'''
'''In a normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution or bell-shaped distribution, there is a specific relationship between its measures of central tendency, namely the mean, median, and mode. This relationship is as follows:

1. **Mean (Average)**:
   - In a normal distribution, the mean (μ) is equal to the median.
   - Mathematically, μ = Median.

2. **Median**:
   - The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order.
   - In a normal distribution, the median is the same as the mean, making it a symmetrical distribution. This is because the normal distribution is symmetric around its mean.

3. **Mode**:
   - The mode represents the most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset.
   - In a normal distribution, there is only one mode, and it is equal to the mean (and median). Therefore, the mode is also at the center of the distribution.

In summary, in a normal distribution:
- The mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.
- The distribution is symmetric, with the same amount of data on both sides of the mean.
- The bell-shaped curve is entirely defined by its mean and standard deviation, and the central tendency measures are all the same value.'''

'''Covariance and correlation are both measures used in statistics to describe the relationship between two variables, but they have some important differences:

1. **Definition**:
   - **Covariance**: Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between the variables (whether they tend to increase or decrease together), but it does not provide information about the strength of the relationship. Covariance can be positive, negative, or zero.

Correlation values range from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.

2. **Scale**:
   - **Covariance**: Covariance values are not standardized and can range from negative infinity to positive infinity. Therefore, the magnitude of covariance depends on the scales of the variables being measured. This makes it challenging to compare covariances across different datasets or variable scales.
   - **Correlation**: Correlation values are standardized and range from -1 to 1, regardless of the scales of the variables. This standardization makes it easier to interpret and compare correlations across different datasets.

3. **Units**:
   - **Covariance**: The units of covariance are the product of the units of the two variables being measured. This makes covariance difficult to interpret because the units can be quite different from the original variables.
   - **Correlation**: Correlation is a dimensionless measure, which means it is not affected by the units of measurement of the variables. This makes it easier to interpret and compare correlations across different datasets.

4. **Interpretation**:
   - **Covariance**: A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same direction, a negative covariance indicates that they tend to move in opposite directions, and a covariance of zero suggests no linear relationship. However, it does not provide a clear sense of the strength or intensity of the relationship.
   - **Correlation**: The correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient) quantifies both the strength and direction of the linear relationship. A correlation coefficient close to -1 or 1 indicates a strong linear relationship, while a coefficient close to 0 suggests a weak or no linear relationship.

In summary, while both covariance and correlation measure the relationship between variables, correlation provides a standardized measure that is easier to interpret and compare, whereas covariance depends on variable scales and units, making it less intuitive for comparing relationships across different datasets or variables. Correlation is the more commonly used measure in practice due to its standardization and interpretability.'''

'''Q14'''
'''Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion, leading to potentially misleading or inaccurate summaries of a dataset. Here's how outliers impact these measures, along with an example:

**Measures of Central Tendency**:

1. **Mean (Average)**:
   - Outliers have a notable impact on the mean. When you have one or more extreme values (outliers) in your dataset, they can pull the mean in the direction of the outliers.
   - For positively skewed data (with a right tail), high outliers will inflate the mean, making it larger than it would be without the outliers.
   - For negatively skewed data (with a left tail), low outliers will drag down the mean, making it smaller than it would be without the outliers.
   - Example: Consider the following dataset representing monthly salaries (in dollars): [3000, 3500, 3200, 3100, 10000]. The outlier (10000) significantly inflates the mean salary.

2. **Median**:
   - The median is less affected by outliers than the mean. It represents the middle value when data is ordered, so extreme values do not have as much influence.
   - The median is often considered a robust measure of central tendency because it is resistant to the influence of outliers.
   - Example: Using the same salary dataset as above, the median salary is unaffected by the outlier and remains in the middle, around 3200 dollars.

3. **Mode**:
   - Outliers may or may not impact the mode, depending on the nature of the data and the specific values of the outliers.
   - If an outlier coincides with a mode, it may change the mode, but if the outlier is distant from the modes, it may not have a significant impact on the mode.
   - Example: If you have a dataset of exam scores with multiple modes around 80 and 90 but include an outlier score of 20, it won't change the modes, but if the outlier is around 90, it may affect the mode.

**Measures of Dispersion**:

1. **Range**:
   - Outliers can significantly affect the range. If you have outliers on either end of the data, the range will be much wider than it would be without them.
   - Example: Consider a dataset of test scores with values in the range of 50 to 95. If you add an outlier score of 120, the range will expand to 120 - 50 = 70, which is much larger than the original range.

2. **Variance and Standard Deviation**:
   - Outliers can greatly influence the variance and standard deviation because they measure how data points deviate from the mean.
   - If you have one or more extreme outliers, the variance and standard deviation will be larger than they would be without the outliers.
   - Example: In a dataset of salaries with a few extremely high values, the variance and standard deviation will be larger, indicating higher variability in income.

In summary, outliers can skew measures of central tendency (especially the mean) and increase measures of dispersion (such as range, variance, and standard deviation). It's important to be aware of the presence of outliers and consider their impact when analyzing data. Depending on the context, you may choose to handle outliers by either excluding them, transforming the data, or reporting central tendency and dispersion measures that are less sensitive to outliers (e.g., median and interquartile range).'''
